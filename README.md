# AirBnB_clone
0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:
AirBnB_clone - The Console is a project aimed at creating a command-line application that mimics the core functionalities of the accommodation rental platform - AirBnB. It provides users with a user-friendly interface to register, login, view amenities and reviews. It serves as a practical learning experience for software development, showcasing the implementation of essential features in a command-line environment.

COMMAND INTERPRETER:
- This is a program that allows users to interact with a computer system by typing commands.
- In Linux, it is started by searching for "Terminal" or pressing Ctrl+Alt+T. Once the window is opened, it is ready to use.
- Uses include creation of an object, add unique method to an object or update existing ones, retrieve or destroy an object.
